Hey, hey, hey
Where do you think you're going?
It's so late, late, late
What's wrong?
I said, "I can't stay, do I have to give a reason?
It's just me, me, me, it's what I want

So how did we get here?
Three weeks now, we've been so caught up
Better if we do this on our own

Before I love you 
I'm gonna leave you 
Before I'm someone you leave behind
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine
